# unix_collector

The unix_collector is a self-contained shell script designed for the forensic collection of various artifacts from Unix-based systems located deep inside internal network. It runs on multiple Unix platforms and gathers data that can be analyzed to identify potential system compromises.

As a single shell script, ```unix_collector``` is easy to upload and execute, without the need for untarring, compiling, installation, or an internet connection to download additional components. The script can be run either as a normal user or as root, though it performs more effectively when executed as root, as this allows it to access a wider range of system files and artifacts.

# Features

* Runs everything from a single script.
* No installation or external libraries needed.
* No internet connection needed.
* Enumerate basic host information such as kernel version, processes, hostname and save details in output directory.
* Enumerate files written to the disk and create basic timeline using 'stat' command.
* Enumerate network information and save details in output directory.
* Enumerate patch and installed software information and save details in output directory.
* Enumerate process list and other process information and save details in output directory.
* Enumerate application lists, plist/apk for iOS/Android save them in output directory.
* Enumerate hardware information.
* Enumerate virtual controller information (ESXi,VMBox,VIRT) and save details in output directory.
* Hash files in various folders such as /home/ /opt/ /usr/ and save details in output directory.
* Hash files which are marked as SGID or SUID and save details in output directory.
* Copy various files such as cron job, plist or other files into output directory.
* Copy SUID/SGID binaries into output directory.
* Copy home and tmp directories into output directory.
* Copy specific /proc/ files into output directory.
* Copy system logs (i.e /var/log or /var/adm/) into output directory.
* Copy /dev/shm into output directory.
* Gather information about containers.
* Where copy or hashing operation happens, files over 500MB will be skipped. This default behavior can be modified inside the script by changing RSYNC_MAX_FILESIZE, TAR_MAX_FILESIZE and HASH_MAX_FILESIZE global variables.
* TAR entire output directory and use hostname as file name with current date.

# Requirements

* Enough space on the disk so logs and other files can be copied into single location (alternatively run from mounted disk or network partition).
* sh

# Examples 

Execute ```unix_collector``` without specifying any operating system version (script will guess OS type):

```chmod +x ./unix_collector.sh && ./unix_collector.sh```

Execute ```unix_collector``` on AIX while specifying platform:

```chmod +x ./unix_collector.sh && ./unix_collector.sh --platform=aix```

Execute ```unix_collector``` on MacOS while specifying platform:

```chmod +x ./unix_collector.sh && ./unix_collector.sh --platform=mac```
